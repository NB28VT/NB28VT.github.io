								</div>

								<p>Fantasy Fishbowl is a fantasy sports app with a twist. Instead of predicting sports performance, players try and guess which songs the Vermont rock band Phish will play ahead of a given concert.</p> 
								
								<p>Before each performance, players attempt to guess which song the band will open with, which song will end the first set, etc. Players earn points for correctly predicting a song is played, and extra points if they correctly guess where it appears in the setlist. It's loosely based on a pen and paper game me and my friends play before their concerts.</p>
									
								<p>Fantasy Fishbowl has always been my major personal project, and it's constantly evolved as my skills as a software developer have improved. The current iteration is by far the most complete, and I hope to have all major features working in 2020.</p>
								
								<h3>Current Features:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Mobile-first web interface for viewing upcoming concerts, making predictions, and comparing your score to your friends.</li>
									<li>Automatic scoring using setlists published after a concert via the <a href="https://phishnet.api-docs.io/v3/the-phish-net-api/welcome" target="_blank">Phish.net fan API.</a></li>
									<li>An API-only backend built with Rails 5.</li>
									<li>A React.js front-end written in TypeScript.</li>
									<li><a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/" target="_blank">JSON Web Token</a> User Authentication.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Check out the frontend source code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/NB28VT/fantasy-fishbowl-typescript-client"  target="_blank">here</a>. The backend source code is <a href="https://github.com/NB28VT/fantasy-fishbowl-rails5API"  target="_blank">here.</a></p>

								</div>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/departure-board400.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A real-time representation of the train departure board at Boston's South Station terminal. This project is built in React.js and utilizes the powerful <a href="https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api" target="_blank">Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority developer API </a>and its <a href="https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api/streaming" target="_blank">streaming service</a> to consistently update train departure predictions.
								</p>

								<h3>Current Features:</h3>

								<ul>
									<li>Predicted departure times, train destinations, train numbers and the status of each trip ("on time", "delayed" etc.).</li>
									<li>Live updates whenever the MBTA server sends out a "reset" event.</li>
									<li>A live clock.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>You can check it out for yourself <a href="https://mbta-departure-board-nb28vt.herokuapp.com/"  target="_blank">here;</a> the source code is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/NB28VT/MBTA-Departure-Board"  target="_blank">here.</a></p>

								</div>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/whosinitboard400.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>"Who's In It?"" is a movie cast matching game I built while teaching myself <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> in 2017. Players search for a movie by title, select from the search results, and are presented with five cast member headshots. They must match each image to a scrambled list of names to win the game. Movie data is retrieved from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target="_blank">The Movie Database API.</a></p>
									
								<p>React has fast become one of my favorite frameworks to work with, and building an interactive game that loads data from an API was a perfect challenge for learning the basics of the framework. You can play the game <a href="https://whos-init.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

								<div class="nb-image-row nb-logo-row">
									<span class="nb-row-image icon"><img src="images/icons8-ruby-programming-language-50.png" alt="" /></span>
								</div>


								<p>Formula One racing has never been very popular in the United States, but it's been one of my favorite sports since I was a kid. So when I discovered the <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/" target="_blank">Ergast F1 stats API</a>, I knew I had to use it in a project.</p>

								<p>Working with APIs was one of the first aspects of software development I really enjoyed, and nobody had written a Ruby wrapper for the Ergast API at the time, so I decided to build my own as a Ruby Gem package. As of Spring 2020, it's been downloaded over <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/ergast_f1" target="_blank">650 times.</a></p>

								<p>The source code is hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/NB28VT/ergast_f1-ruby" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/headshot300.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>I've been coding since before the day I was born. I mastered COBOL and Visual Basic before I could walk, had a full command of Java by the third grade, and convinced some guy named Matz to call his new programming language "Ruby" before I could legally drive.</p>

								<p>Just kidding.</p>
								
								<p>The truth is, software engineering is my second career. Until 2014, I was an aspiring journalist in my home state of Vermont, writing award-winning work for a critically-acclaimed small town newspaper. After moving to Boston and getting hooked on code through <a href="https://learncodethehardway.org/python/" target="_blank">Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way"</a> I decided the innovative, technically challenging world of software was exactly where I wanted to be.</p>
								
								<p>That fall, I went to a Ruby on Rails bootcamp, and I've been understanding programming memes ever since.</p>
								
								<p>In my roughly five years in the industry I've worked on all sorts of interesting projects for a handful of Boston start-ups, from API integrations to re-architecting legacy code to building custom features for product and support teams. I've always enjoyed the "people" side of software as much as the engineering - solving challenges together as a team, meeting with stakeholders, and iterating on ideas.</p>
								
								<p>You'll find a collection of my current and past personal projects here. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, they are very nerdy.</p>

									<li>Preserved thousands of dollars in monthly revenue from European customers by updating “Retain” payment recovery integration with Zuora to meet new EU security mandate. Zuora API amongst the hardest in ProfitWell’s system to work with. (Python)</li>
